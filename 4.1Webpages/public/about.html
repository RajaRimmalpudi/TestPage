<h1>About Me</h1>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>My name is Raja Rimmalapudi, a dedicated and passionate CAD Customization professional with a robust background in
    mechanical engineering and software development. With a career that spans several years, I've honed my expertise in
    developing automation tools and customized software solutions that enhance the efficiency and accuracy of CAD
    processes.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ideal Institute of Technology, where I developed a solid foundation in
    engineering principles and design methodologies. My education has provided me with the technical knowledge and
    analytical skills necessary to excel in the field of CAD customization.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>My professional journey began with Jytra, where I was introduced to the world of CAD programming. I quickly became
    proficient in VB.Net, WinForms, and NXOpen, allowing me to take on complex projects such as file conversions, drawing
    preferences, and automation of design processes.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Throughout my career, I have continually expanded my skill set to stay at the forefront of technological
    advancements. I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including VB.Net and VC#.Net, and have mastered the
    use of various CAD tools such as NX, Solid Edge, and AutoCAD.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>My specialization in CAD programming has been pivotal to my success. I have a deep understanding of NXOpen, UFUNC,
    and UIBlocksStyler, which I have leveraged to create highly efficient tools that automate repetitive tasks, reduce
    manual errors, and save valuable time for engineers and designers.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>One of the most significant projects in my career was the development of a BOM (Bill of Materials) Extractor tool
    during my tenure at Harita Techserv. This tool drastically reduced the time required to generate BOMs from 20 minutes
    to just 5 seconds, showcasing my ability to create impactful solutions.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>I approach every project with a problem-solving mindset, constantly seeking ways to optimize processes and enhance
    functionality. My experience with migrating tools from NX 8.5 to NX 11 at TechnipFMC is a testament to my ability to
    tackle complex challenges and deliver solutions that meet the evolving needs of the industry.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Automation has been a recurring theme in my career. From automating the update of model expressions and drafting
    views to developing tools for fitting automation, I have consistently sought to reduce manual intervention and
    increase the efficiency of design processes.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Understanding the needs of my clients has always been a priority for me. I work closely with stakeholders to ensure
    that the solutions I develop are tailored to their specific requirements, whether it's customizing drafting
    preferences or automating the generation of templates in NX.</p>
</li>
  
<li>
  <p>One of my key strengths is my attention to detail. This trait has been particularly valuable in projects like the
    Checker tool at TechnipFMC, where identifying errors in models and drafting required a meticulous approach to ensure
    the highest levels of accuracy.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>I believe that continuous learning is essential in the ever-evolving field of CAD customization. I stay updated with
    the latest industry trends and technologies, which enables me to bring innovative ideas and techniques to my work,
    ensuring that I remain a valuable asset to any organization.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Collaboration is another aspect of my professional life that I greatly value. I have had the privilege of working
    with talented teams across different companies, where I contributed to the collective success of projects by sharing
    my knowledge, offering insights, and learning from my peers.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Outside of work, I have a passion for basketball, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance. I also enjoy
    listening to music and playing video games, which provide me with creative inspiration and a means to unwind after a
    productive day at work.</p>
</li>

  <li>
    <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to further my career in CAD customization by taking on more challenging projects and
      exploring new technologies. I am particularly interested in the potential of artificial intelligence and machine
      learning to revolutionize CAD processes, and I am eager to integrate these technologies into my future work.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I am a driven and detail-oriented professional with a deep passion for CAD customization. My technical
      skills, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to continuous improvement make me well-equipped to tackle any
      challenge in this field. I look forward to contributing my expertise to future projects and continuing my journey of
      innovation and growth in the world of CAD and mechanical engineering.</p>
